Description: A package to evaluate missing data, simulate data matrices and missingness, 
    evaluate multiple imputation methods and return statistics on these and finally methods to 
    impute utilizing multiple standard imputation approaches. Novel imputation methodologies 
    which utilize an imputation approach with data that uses biological or technical replication
    are also included (as described in ***paper***). ICC evaluation methods are included specifically
    included to suit researchers working with data with biological or technical replicates. Source code 
    was written by the authors with code copied and modified from the following github packages:
